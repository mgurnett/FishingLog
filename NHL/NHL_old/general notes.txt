API Status Code
200: Everything went okay, and the result has been returned (if any).
301: The server is redirecting you to a different endpoint. This can happen when a company switches domain names, or an endpoint name is changed.
400: The server thinks you made a bad request. This can happen when you don’t send along the right data, among other things.
401: The server thinks you’re not authenticated. Many APIs require login ccredentials, so this happens when you don’t send the right credentials to access an API.
403: The resource you’re trying to access is forbidden: you don’t have the right permissions to see it.
404: The resource you tried to access wasn’t found on the server.
503: The server is not ready to handle the request.
With 200 respone code we are good to start looking at the conent.
