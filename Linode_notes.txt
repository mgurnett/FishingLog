To update FROM Github

first option is to:
./update.sh

git reset --hard
This will force the Linode site to be the same as Github.  You have to git pull to then update.

You then need to change the group of db.sqlite to www-data
ls -al shows ownership.
sudo chgrp www-data db.sqlite3

To update TO Github

git add .
git commit -am "notes"
git push


All of this should work as it has been tested.
Here is the proof of the test - this line was written at Linode

Permission information

sudo chown :www-data FishingLog/db.sqlite3
    :www-data - tells linux to change the group of the file
    www-data is the user name of apache

sudo chmod 664 FishingLog/db.sqlite3
    664 is owner then group then everyone else
    7 is execute
    6 is write
    4 is read

sudo chown :www-data FishingLog
    change the group for the whole FishingLog

sudo chown -R :www-data FishingLog/media/
    -R is recursive
    Change all in the media file to the group of apache or www-data

sudo chmod 775 FishingLog/media
