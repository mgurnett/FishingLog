To update FROM Github

first option is to:
./update.sh

git reset --hard
This will force the Linode site to be the same as Github.  You have to git pull to then update.

You then need to change the group of db.sqlite to www-data
ls -al shows ownership.
sudo chgrp www-data db.sqlite3

To update TO Github

git add .
git commit -am "notes"
git push


All of this should work as it has been tested.
