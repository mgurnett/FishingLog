STRAIN_INFO = 'Strain - There are many different “strains” or genetically different variations of fish each with their own set of characteristics. These characteristics may cause a strain to grow better, be easier to catch, or have a higher survival rate in stocked waterbodies. These strains can be compared to determine which strain performs better in the hatchery or stocked waterbody to deliver the highest-quality recreational fishery possible.'
GENOTYPE_INFO = 'Genotype (Ploidy) - Sterile trout are raised and stocked in many parts of Alberta to reduce potential impacts to native trout populations. These sterile trout have a third copy of genetic material in their cells, through a process known as triploiding. \Sterile stocked trout will not spawn with wild trout populations nor deplete the genetic diversity of native species. Triploid fish are sterile and do not develop sexual organs. Because they do not put their energy into spawning, they can grow to be larger sooner, making them an ideal candidate for stocking into a trout pond for harvest. '
