To update FROM Github

first option is to:
./update.sh

git reset --hard
This will force the Linode site to be the same as Github.  You have to git pull to then update.

You then need to change the group of db.sqlite to www-data
ls -al shows ownership.
sudo chgrp www-data db.sqlite3

To update TO Github

git add .
git commit -am "notes"
git push

=====================
All of this should work as it has been tested.
Here is the proof of the test - this line was written at Linode
======================
Permission information

sudo chown :www-data FishingLog/db.sqlite3
    :www-data - tells linux to change the group of the file
    www-data is the user name of apache

sudo chmod 664 FishingLog/db.sqlite3
    664 is owner then group then everyone else
    7 is execute
    6 is write
    4 is read

sudo chown :www-data FishingLog
    change the group for the whole FishingLog

sudo chown -R :www-data FishingLog/media/
    -R is recursive
    Change all in the media file to the group of apache or www-data

sudo chmod -R 775 FishingLog/media
====================

To know which user you are logged on to:

$ whoami
ubuntu
And adding to your solution, if you are using an AWS Instance, you should add your user to the group to be able to access that folder:

Making a group for webservices users (varwwwusers)
$ sudo groupadd varwwwusers
Change the www folder and make it belong to varwwwusers
$ sudo chgrp -R varwwwusers /var/www/
www-data is the server making django requests, add that to the group
$ sudo adduser www-data varwwwusers
Change folder policy
$ sudo chmod -R 770 /var/www/
Add ubuntu to the group of varwwwusers
$ usermod -a -G varwwwusers ubuntu
Hope this helps!
===================

systemctl restart apache2
==============================

Current status:
Everything is Owner: michael  Group: www-data  Permissions: 770
db.sqlite3 is 664
/media is 775
